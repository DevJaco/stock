# What is it? 

This project explores the concept of modelling financial share prices using various machine learning techniques.
The model will most likely be trained using US shares and prices, or cryptocurrency data, as
these data sets are easier to access freely.

# Milestones

Develop an understanding and ability to use various machine learning techniques in
practical applications.
Develop a model able to make predictions on whether a share price will increase or
decrease over a set period of time (daily/weekly).
Train the model using historical real-world data.
Develop a way to effectively back test the model using historical share data so that its
accuracy can be quantified and improved.
